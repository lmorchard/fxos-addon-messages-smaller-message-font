fxos-addon-messages-smaller-message-font
----------------------------------------

I had a few annoyances with using the Messages app on Firefox OS. This addon
does the following things:

* Font size of messages is slightly smaller - because I have a nice screen on
  this phone and want to see more messages at once.

TODO:

* Settings to change message font size
